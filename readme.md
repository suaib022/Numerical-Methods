# 📘 Numerical Methods Repository (C++ Implementation)

_A comprehensive repository for numerical methods, with detailed theory and C++ code implementations._

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains a complete collection of **Numerical Methods** implemented in **C++**, designed to solve a variety of problems in computational mathematics. It includes both theoretical explanations and fully functional code examples.

The repository is structured to be an educational resource for students, professionals, and researchers working with numerical techniques in fields such as engineering, physics, and applied mathematics.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Document** and **implement** numerical methods in C++
- Provide **theoretical background** and **step-by-step derivations** for each method
- Offer **clean, efficient, and well-commented C++ code** implementations for each numerical method
- Build a **reference library** for common computational tasks (root-finding, linear algebra, ODE solvers, etc.)

## 🧩 Methods Included

This repository will feature the following categories of numerical methods:

- **Root-Finding Methods**

  - Bisection Method
  - False Position Method
  - Newton-Raphson Method
  - Secant Method

- **Linear Algebra Methods**

  - Gaussian Elimination
